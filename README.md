# 🏆 BINUS TechFest 2025 – Data Analytics Competition

## 📌 Overview
The BINUS TechFest 2025 Data Analytics Competition is a data analysis competition organized by BINUS University.  
The competition challenges participants to explore, process, and analyze data in order to generate meaningful, data-driven insights based on a given case study.

This repository documents our team’s analytical workflow, with a primary focus on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** as the foundation for understanding the dataset and extracting insights.
